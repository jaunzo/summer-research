Version 2.0

This program can generate embedded trees from a small, binary, phylogenetic 
network, calculate rooted subtree prune and regraft distance (drSPR) and 
create an rSPR graph from a small set of trees. 

Graphviz must be installed to enable graph visualisation.

Release notes v2.0:
- Added rspr graph functionality
- Added drSPR functionality
- Fixed bug that showed duplicate trees with graphics enabled when trees window 
  is closed and immediately opened again by clicking "Show trees" button
- Fixed multiple error messages showing on "Select leaves" window when making 
  an error twice in a row
