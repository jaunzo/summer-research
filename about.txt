Version 2.0

This program takes a small binary phylogenetic network in extended newick format
and generates trees displayed by the network. It can also calculate drSPR when 
given at least 2 trees. When more than 2 trees are inputted, all trees are 
compared pairwise. It can open text files containing the network in newick format 
and export the generated network as text or image files.

Graphviz must be installed to enable graph visualisation.

Release notes v2.0:
- Added drSPR functionality
- Fixed bug that showed duplicate trees with graphics enabled when trees window 
  is closed and immediately opened again by clicking "Show trees" button
