of leaves.


Show trees:
-----------
Opens a window that shows all unique trees with the number of occurences 
displayed above each tree when generating all embedded trees from a network. 
By default, trees are displayed with all labelled leaves.

When calculating drSPR, this opens a window that visualises all entered valid 
trees with tree number displayed above each tree if graphics is enabled.


Enable graphics:
----------------
Enabled: Network and trees will be drawn as graphs. Graphviz must be installed.
Disabled: Network and trees will be printed as text on the main window.

This program can draw trees of networks that have less than 7 reticulations 
and/or 10 leaves. Run the program without graph visualisation if the input 
network contains less than 10 reticulations and/or 15-20 leaves.
